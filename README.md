# ARM Pipelined CPU
This project focuses on designing a 64-bit ARM CPU with Pipelining. This pipelined CPU
will have 1 delay slot after each load and branch instruction. It is
also responsible for covering data forwarding. Sample instruction
sequences with which to test this CPU is provided, and the test will have to display the modified
registers at the end of the execution.
